# rusty-chess-core

This is a small library for playing chess. It is a work in progress and contains
the core logic for playing the game.

See the [rusty-chess-gui](https://crates.io/crates/rusty-chess-gui) crate for
a graphical user interface and the [rusty-chess-cli](https://crates.io/crates/rusty-chess-cli)
crate for a command line interface. Both of which use this library.

## Installation

You need to have cargo installed. You can install it by following the instructions
on the [rust-lang](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) page.

Then simply run:

```shell
cargo add rusty-chess-core
```
